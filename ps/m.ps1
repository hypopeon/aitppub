.SYNOPSIS
    Provides a menu-driven interface to download and execute PowerShell scripts from URLs.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script displays a menu of script categories. Upon selection, it shows a sub-menu
    of available scripts. Choosing a script will download its content using
    Invoke-RestMethod (irm) and execute it using Invoke-Expression (iex).

.WARNING
    EXTREME CAUTION IS ADVISED. This script uses 'Invoke-Expression' (iex) to run code
    downloaded directly from the internet without prior inspection. This is a significant
    security risk. Only use this script with URLs you own and trust completely.
    Running scripts from untrusted sources can lead to severe system compromise,
    data loss, or malware infection.

# --- SCRIPT CONFIGURATION ---
# Define the menu structure. Add categories as keys and an array of script objects as values.
# Each script object should have a 'Name' for the menu and a 'Url' for the script source.
$menuConfiguration = @{
    "Scripts" = @(
        @{ Name = "1. PowerShell: Modern Standby-problem"; Url = "https://hypopeon.github.io/aitppub/ps/modernstandby.ps1" },

    )
    "Misc" = @(
        @{ Name = "TBA"; Url = "" }
